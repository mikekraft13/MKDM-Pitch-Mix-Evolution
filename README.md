# MKDM-Pitch-Mix-Evolution

# We are filtering out all rows of data from each year that are NULL in the pitch_type field
## Perhaps talk about how little of an impact this makes on the analysis (.25% of 2014 dataset for example)

# All game types are regular season
# at_bat_number field is REALLY with respect to Plate Appearance of the game
# pitch_number is total pitch number of the Plate Appearance
# Getting rid of all fields regarding shift - primarily due to the fact that current day baseball has banned the shift




(02/27/25) Note on grids (with respect to facet_grid_example) in static folder:

  - For the pitch-based metric graphs (Dan):
    - PITCH USAGE on y-axis (where Freq is in example)
    - PITCH VELOCITY will be the color of points
    - PITCHER HANDEDNESS on y-portion splitting of graphs (where Child and Adult are listed in example)
    - BATTER HANDEDNESS on x-portion splitting of graphs (where Male and Female are listed in example)
    - YEAR on x-axis (where Class is located in example)
    - PITCH TYPE will be the shape of the points
  
  - For the hitter-based metric graphs (Mike):
    - HITTING METRIC on y-axis (where Freq is in example)
    - PITCH VELOCITY will be the color of points
    - PITCHER HANDEDNESS on y-portion splitting of graphs (where Child and Adult are listed in example)
    - BATTER HANDEDNESS on x-portion splitting of graphs (where Male and Female are listed in example)
    - YEAR on x-axis (where Class is located in example)
    - PITCH TYPE will be the shape of the points
