# MKDM-Pitch-Mix-Evolution

# We are filtering out all rows of data from each year that are NULL in the pitch_type field
## Perhaps talk about how little of an impact this makes on the analysis (.25% of 2014 dataset for example)

# All game types are regular season
# at_bat_number field is REALLY with respect to Plate Appearance of the game
# pitch_number is total pitch number of the Plate Appearance
# Getting rid of all fields regarding shift - primarily due to the fact that current day baseball has banned the shift
